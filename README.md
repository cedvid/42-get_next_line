# GET_NEXT_LINE - 42 Project

The "get_next_line" project involves implementing a function that takes a file descriptor as an argument and reads from it, returning the next line each time it is called. By completing this project, I gained practical experience in file input/output operations, memory management using buffers, error handling, and algorithmic thinking for efficient line reading.

### Instructions


| Function name| get_next_line|
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Prototype| char *get_next_line(int fd);|
| Parameters   | fd: The file descriptor to read from        |
| Return value | Read line: correct behavior <br> NULL: there is nothing else to read,<br>or an error occurred |
| External functs. | read, malloc, free |
|Description|Write a function that returns a line read from a <br>file descriptor|
